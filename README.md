# Java Programming 8th by Joyce Farrell Exercises
This is a compilation of the solutions written to the programming exercises found in the book. The exercises cover topics such as variables, classes, objects, control-flow statements, and basic Java syntax. At the end of practices, I was able to:
* Describe the role of data structures and algorithms in programming.
* Describe basic data types and more evolved structures in which data can be stored.
* Recognize examples where specific data structures are suited for solving specific types of programming problems.
* Be familiar with a number of important computer algorithms using those structures.
* Understand how to implement data structures and algorithms using different techniques.
* Convert a business process into the data structures and algorithms required to model it.
